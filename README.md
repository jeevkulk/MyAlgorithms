# datastructures and algorithms

**List of Algorithms:**

**Rotate Matrix:** Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
**Refer: algorithm/array/MatrixRotation**

**Is Unique:** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?
**Refer: algorithm/string/HasUniqueChars**

**Check Permutation:** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other
**Refer: algorithm/string/CheckPermutation**

**Palindrome Permutation:** Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
_EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)_
