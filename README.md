# List of Algorithms

**1. Rotate Matrix:** Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
Refer: src/main/java/algorithm/array/MatrixRotation

**2. Is Unique:** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
Refer: src/main/java/algorithm/string/HasUniqueChars

**3. Check Permutation:** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
Refer: src/main/java/algorithm/string/CheckPermutation

**4. Palindrome Permutation:** Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
_EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)_
Refer: src/main/java/algorithm/string/CheckPalindromePermutation

**5. Shakespeare Word Usage Analysis** Given two files (refer to resoruces directory), one containing words used by Shakespeare and the other containing all the words in Webster dictionary - find the following:
 _(i) Total Number of Distinct Words in Webster Dictionary
 (ii) Total Number of Distinct Words used by Shakespeare
 (iii) Number of Words in dictionary used by Shakespeare
 (iv) Number of Words in dictionary but not used by Shakespeare
 (v) Number of Words used by Shakespeare but not in dictionary_
